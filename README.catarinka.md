## Compatibility

All components here work with the latest Delphi releases (for both 32-bit and 64-bit compilation) and the older D7. Most of them may work with FPC and Lazarus with minor modifications.

Most components can be cross-compiled with Delphi XE10 Tokyo and CrossVCL.

### Before Compiling

CatPrefs: Rename the `src\CatCryptKey.pas` file, edit it and add your own encryption keys or key generators.
