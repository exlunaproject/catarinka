# The Catarinka Libraries

This repository contains the source code and documentation for two related projects:

* **Catalunya** - This is a Lua library that extends Lua with [over 60 functions](https://github.com/exlunaproject/catarinka/blob/master/catalunya/docs/lua.functions.md) and some useful classes. The project's goal is to make the development of Lua applications easier and to push the boundaries of the Lua language to do innovative things. Catalunya is compatible with Lua and LuaJIT for Windows.
* **Catarinka** - This is a [large set of useful libraries](https://github.com/exlunaproject/catarinka/blob/master/README.catarinka.md) for Delphi. The libraries work with the latest Delphi releases (for both 32-bit and 64-bit compilation) and older Delphi versions.

Both projects were originally developed to be used in the [Sandcat Browser](https://github.com/syhunt/sandcat) but can be used separately with any Lua-based or Delphi application.
